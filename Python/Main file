divmod: Take two (non complex) numbers as arguments and return a pair of numbers consisting of their quotient and remainder 
         when using integer division.
         
         Example: carry, val = divmod(v1+v2+carry, 10)
         Here carry = quotient, val = remainder
         Carry on the right side is the carry previously carried.
         
         
reverse a string : s[::-1]

There is a bool data type (which inherits from int and has only two values: True and False).
